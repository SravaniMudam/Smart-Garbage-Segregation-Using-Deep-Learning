# Smart-Garbage-Segregation-Using-Deep-Learning
## Project Overview

The Smart Waste Segregation System is a web-based application that uses Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning techniques to classify waste images into different categories such as Organic, Recyclable, and Hazardous.

This system helps improve waste management practices by automatically identifying the type of waste and suggesting proper disposal methods. The project promotes environmental sustainability and supports smart city initiatives.

## Objectives

To automatically detect and classify waste using image processing.

To build a user-friendly web interface for waste image upload.

To provide proper disposal suggestions based on waste category.

To reduce manual effort in waste segregation.

## Features

Upload waste images through website interface.

AI-based waste classification using CNN model.

Displays prediction result with confidence score.

Provides disposal recommendations.

Simple and easy-to-use web interface.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

### Backend

Python

Flask

Machine Learning

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Pandas

## Model Details

Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Trained on waste image dataset

Classifies waste into predefined categories

Provides prediction confidence percentage

## Waste Categories

The system classifies waste into:

cardboard
glass
metal
plastic
paper
trash

## Project Workflow

User uploads a waste image through the web application.

The image is preprocessed for model compatibility.

The trained CNN model analyzes the image.

The system predicts the waste category.

The result and disposal suggestion are displayed on the website.

## Future Enhancements

Real-time camera integration.

IoT-based smart dustbin integration.

Cloud deployment (AWS / Azure).

Mobile application version.

Addition of more waste categories.
